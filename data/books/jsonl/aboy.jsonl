{"id": 7, "text": "Many of the religious and philosophical concepts and methods he introduced decades ago are now finding expression in education, psychology, business, medicine, and other spheres of endeavour—contributing in far-reaching ways to a more integrated, humane, and spiritual vision of human life."}
{"id": 8, "text": "The fact that Paramahansa Yoganandaji’s teachings are being interpreted and creatively applied in many different fields, as well as by exponents of diverse philosophical and metaphysical movements, points not only to the great practical utility of what he taught, but also to the need for some means of ensuring that the spiritual legacy he left not be diluted, fragmented, or distorted with the passing of time."}

{"id": 37, "text": "As an eyewitness recountal of the extraordinary lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the book has importance both timely and timeless. To its illustrious author, whom I have had the pleasure of knowing in both India and America, may every reader render due appreciation and gratitude."}

{"id": 39, "text": "A likeness of the venerable saint appeared as part of the frontispiece of my Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines. 1 It was at Puri, in Odisha, on the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar."}
{"id": 40, "text": "He was then the head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly occupied in the spiritual training of a group of youthful disciples."}
{"id": 41, "text": "He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the people of the United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those in California, of his chief disciple, Paramahansa Yogananda, whom he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to the West."}
{"id": 42, "text": "Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration that his followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, held him in the highest esteem."}
{"id": 43, "text": "I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, robed in the saffron-coloured garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded."}
{"id": 44, "text": "His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic."}
{"id": 45, "text": "He had chosen as his place of earthly abode the holy city of Puri, whither multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath, “Lord of the World.” It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of being and passed on, knowing that his incarnation had been carried to a triumphant completion."}
{"id": 46, "text": "I am glad, indeed, to be able to record this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar. Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly and in tranquillity to that ideal life which Paramahansa Yogananda, his disciple, has now described for the ages."}

{"id": 60, "text": "Hailed as a masterpiece when it first appeared in print more than sixty years ago, the book set forth not only the story of a life of unmistakable greatness but a fascinating introduction to the spiritual thought of the East—especially its unique science of direct personal communion with God—opening up to the Western public a realm of knowledge hitherto accessible only to a few."}
{"id": 61, "text": "Today Autobiography of a Yogi is recognised around the world as a classic of spiritual literature. In this introduction, we would like to share some of the book’s extraordinary history. The writing of the work had been prophesied long ago."}
{"id": 62, "text": "One of the seminal figures in the renaissance of yoga in modern times, the revered nineteenth-century master Lahiri Mahasaya, had foretold: “About fifty years after my passing, an account of my life will be written because of a deep interest in yoga that will arise in the West."}
{"id": 63, "text": "The message of yoga will encircle the globe. It will aid in establishing the brotherhood of man: a unity based on humanity’s direct perception of the One Father.”\n Many years later, Lahiri Mahasaya’s exalted disciple Swami Sri Yukteswar related this prophecy to Sri Yogananda."}
{"id": 64, "text": "“You must do your part in spreading that message,” he declared, “and in writing that sacred life.”\nIt was in 1945, exactly fifty years after Lahiri Mahasaya’s passing, that Paramahansa Yogananda completed his Autobiography of a Yogi, which amply fulfilled both of his guru’s injunctions: providing, the first detailed presentation in English of Lahiri Mahasaya’s remarkable life, and introducing to a world audience India’s age-old science of the soul."}
{"id": 65, "text": "The creation of Autobiography of a Yogi was a project that Paramahansa Yogananda worked on over a period of many years. Sri Daya Mata, one of his earliest and closest disciples, 1 recalls:\n“When I came to Mount Washington in 1931, Paramahansaji had already begun to work on the Autobiography."}
{"id": 66, "text": "Once when I was in his study attending to some secretarial duties, I was privileged to see one of the first chapters he wrote—it was on ‘The Tiger Swami.’ He asked me to save it, and explained that it would be going into a book he was writing."}
{"id": 67, "text": "Most of the book was composed later, between 1937 and 1945.”\nFrom June 1935 through October 1936, Sri Yogananda had made a return trip to India (via Europe and Palestine) for a last visit with his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar."}
{"id": 68, "text": "While there, he had compiled much factual data for the Autobiography, as well as stories about some of the saints and sages whom he had known and whose lives he was to describe so memorably in the book."}
{"id": 69, "text": "“I had never forgotten Sri Yukteswar’s request that I write the life of Lahiri Mahasaya,” he later wrote. “During my stay in India I was taking every opportunity to contact direct disciples and relatives of the Yogavatar."}
{"id": 70, "text": "Recording their conversations in voluminous notes, I verified facts and dates, and collected photographs, old letters, and documents.”\nUpon his return to the United States at the end of 1936, he began to spend much of his time at the hermitage that had been built for him in his absence, in Encinitas on the southern California coast."}
{"id": 71, "text": "It proved to be an ideal place to concentrate on completing the book he had begun years before. “Still vivid in my memory are the days spent in that peaceful seaside hermitage,” recounts Sri Daya Mata."}
{"id": 72, "text": "“He had so many other responsibilities and commitments that he was not able to work on the Autobiography every day; but in general he devoted the evenings to it, and whatever free time he could spare. Beginning around 1939 or ’40, he was able to concentrate full time on the book."}
{"id": 73, "text": "And full time it was—from early morning until early morning! A small group of us disciples—Tara Mata; my sister, Ananda Mata; Sraddha Mata; and myself—were present to assist him. After each part was typed, he would give it to Tara Mata, who served as his editor."}
{"id": 74, "text": "“What treasured memories! As he wrote, he relived inwardly the sacred experiences he was recording. His divine intent was to share the joy and revelations encountered in the company of saints and great masters and in one’s own personal realization of the Divine."}
{"id": 75, "text": "Often he would pause for a time, his gaze uplifted and his body motionless, rapt in the samadhi state of deep communion with God. The whole room would be filled with a tremendously powerful aura of divine love."}
{"id": 76, "text": "For us disciples, merely to be present at such times was to be lifted into a higher state of consciousness. “Finally, in 1945, came the jubilant day of the book’s completion."}
{"id": 77, "text": "Paramahansaji wrote the last words, ‘Lord, thou hast given this monk a large family’; then laid down his pen and joyously exclaimed:\n“‘All done; it is finished. This book will change the lives of millions. It will be my messenger when I am gone.’”"}
{"id": 78, "text": "It then became Tara Mata’s responsibility to find a publisher. Paramahansa Yogananda had met Tara Mata while conducting a series of lectures and classes in San Francisco in 1924. Possessed of rare spiritual insight, she became one of the small circle of his most advanced disciples."}
{"id": 79, "text": "He held her editorial abilities in highest esteem, and used to say that she had one of the most brilliant minds of anyone he had ever met."}
{"id": 80, "text": "He appreciated her vast knowledge and understanding of India’s scriptural wisdom, and remarked on one occasion: “Excepting my great guru, Sri Yukteswarji, there is no one with whom I have more enjoyed talking of Indian philosophy.”\n Tara Mata took the manuscript to New York City."}
{"id": 81, "text": "But finding a publisher was not an easy task. As can often be observed, the true stature of a great work may not at first be recognised by those of a more conventional cast of mind."}
{"id": 82, "text": "Despite the newly born atomic age having enlarged the collective consciousness of humanity with a growing understanding of the subtle unity of matter, energy, and thought, the publishers of the day were hardly ready for such chapters as “Materialising a palace in the Himalayas” and “The Saint With Two Bodies”!\nFor a year, Tara Mata lived in a sparsely furnished, unheated cold-water flat while making the rounds of publishing houses."}
{"id": 83, "text": "At last she was able to send a cable with news of success. The Philosophical Library, a respected New York publisher, had accepted the Autobiography for publication. “What [she] has done for this book I cannot begin to describe...,” Sri Yogananda said."}
{"id": 84, "text": "“But for her, the book would never have gone through.”\nShortly before Christmas 1946, the long-awaited books reached Mount Washington. The book was greeted by readers and by the world press with an outpouring of appreciative praise."}
{"id": 85, "text": "“There has been nothing before, written in English or in any other language, like this presentation of Yoga,” wrote Columbia University Press in its Review of Religions ."}
{"id": 86, "text": "The New York Times proclaimed it “a rare account.” Newsweek reported, “Yogananda’s book is rather an autobiography of the soul than of the body…It is a fascinating and clearly annotated study of a religious way of life, ingenuously described in the lush style of the Orient.”\nWith the translation of the book into other languages, many more reviews began appearing in newspapers and periodicals around the world."}
{"id": 87, "text": "A second edition was quickly prepared, and in 1951 a third."}
{"id": 88, "text": "In addition to revising and updating portions of the text, and deleting some passages describing organisational activities and plans that were no longer current, Paramahansa Yogananda added a final chapter—one of the longest in the book—covering the years 1940–1951."}
{"id": 89, "text": "In a footnote to the new chapter, he wrote, “Much new material in Chapter 49 has been added to the third\n edition of this book (1951)."}
{"id": 90, "text": "In response to requests made by a number of readers of the first two editions, I have answered, in this chapter, various questions about India, yoga, and Vedic philosophy.” 2\n“I have been intensely moved,” Sri Yogananda wrote in an Author’s Note to the 1951 edition, “to receive letters from thousands of readers."}
{"id": 91, "text": "Their comments and the fact that the book has been translated into many languages, encourages me to believe that the West has found in these pages an affirmative answer to the question: ‘Has the ancient science of yoga any worthwhile place in the life of the modern man?’”\nWith the passing years “thousands of readers” became millions, and the enduring and universal appeal of Autobiography of a Yogi has become increasingly apparent."}
{"id": 92, "text": "Sixty years after the book was first published, it is still appearing on metaphysical and inspirational best-seller lists."}
{"id": 93, "text": "A rare phenomenon! Available in many translations, it is now being used in colleges and universities all over the world in courses ranging from Eastern philosophy and religion to English literature, psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, and even business management."}
{"id": 94, "text": "As predicted more than a century ago by Lahiri Mahasaya, the message of yoga and its ancient tradition of meditation has indeed encircled the globe."}
{"id": 95, "text": "“Perhaps best known for his Autobiography of a Yogi, which has inspired countless millions around the world,” writes the metaphysical journal New Frontier (October 1986), “Paramahansa Yogananda, like Gandhi, brought spirituality into the mainstream of society."}

{"id": 140, "text": "Father and Mother were Bengalis, of the Kshatriya caste. 4 Both were blessed with saintly nature. Their mutual love, tranquil and dignified, never expressed itself frivolously. A perfect parental harmony was the calm centre for the revolving tumult of eight young lives."}

{"id": 142, "text": "After her death, Father displayed more of his inner tenderness. I noticed then that his gaze often seemed to be metamorphosed into my mother’s gaze. In Mother’s presence we children made an early bittersweet acquaintance with the scriptures."}

{"id": 146, "text": "One fortnight Mother spent, in feeding the poor, more than Father’s monthly income. “All I ask, please,” Father said, “is that you keep your charities within a reasonable limit.” Even a gentle rebuke from her husband was grievous to\n Mother."}

{"id": 149, "text": "“Please give me ten rupees for a hapless woman who has just arrived at the house.” Mother’s smile had its own persuasion. “Why ten rupees? One is enough.” Father added a justification: “When my father and grandparents died suddenly, I had my first experience of poverty."}
{"id": 150, "text": "My only breakfast, before walking miles to my school, was a small banana. Later, at the university, I was in such need that I applied to a wealthy judge for aid of one rupee per month."}

{"id": 154, "text": "An aversion to instant acceptance is really only honouring the principle of “due reflection.” I always found Father reasonable and evenly balanced in his judgments."}
{"id": 155, "text": "If I could bolster up my numerous requests with one or two good arguments, he would invariably put within my reach the coveted goal—whether a vacation trip or a new motorcycle. Father was a strict disciplinarian to his children in their early years, but his attitude toward himself was truly Spartan."}
{"id": 156, "text": "He never visited the theatre, for instance, but sought his recreation in various spiritual practices and in\n reading the Bhagavad Gita. Shunning all luxuries, he would cling to one old pair of shoes until they were useless."}

{"id": 162, "text": "Much later he was questioned by my youngest brother Bishnu, who had noticed the large deposit on a bank statement. “Why be elated by material profit?” Father replied. “The one who pursues a goal of even-mindedness is neither jubilant with gain nor depressed by loss."}
{"id": 163, "text": "He knows that man arrives penniless in this world, and departs without a single rupee.”\nEarly in their married life, my parents became disciples of a great master, Lahiri Mahasaya of Banaras. This association strengthened Father’s naturally ascetical temperament."}
{"id": 164, "text": "Mother once made a remarkable admission to my eldest sister Roma: “Your father and I sleep together as man and wife only once a year, for the purpose of having children.”\nFather met Lahiri Mahasaya through Abinash Babu, 5 an employee of a branch line of Bengal-Nagpur Railway."}

{"id": 167, "text": "“Years ago, before you were born, I asked my superior officer—your father—to give me a week’s leave from my office duties in order to visit my guru in Banaras. Your father ridiculed my plan. “ ‘Are you going to become a religious fanatic?’ he enquired."}

{"id": 172, "text": "On my knees I was exclaiming, ‘Lahiri Mahasaya! Lahiri Mahasaya!’ For a few moments your father was motionless with stupefaction. “ ‘Abinash, not only do I give you leave, but I give myself leave to start for Banaras tomorrow."}
{"id": 173, "text": "I must know this great Lahiri Mahasaya, who is able to materialise himself at will in order to intercede for you! I will take my wife and ask this master to initiate us in his spiritual path."}

{"id": 176, "text": "He blinked his piercing eyes and levelled them on your father. ‘Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!’ His words were the same as those he had used two days before in the grassy field."}
{"id": 177, "text": "He added, ‘I am glad that you have permitted Abinash to visit me, and that you and your wife have accompanied him.’\n“To their joy, he initiated your parents in the spiritual practice of Kriya Yoga."}
{"id": 178, "text": "7 Your father and I, as brother disciples, have been close friends since the memorable day of the vision. Lahiri Mahasaya took a definite interest in your own birth."}
{"id": 179, "text": "Your life shall surely be linked with his own; the master’s blessing never fails.”\nLahiri Mahasaya left this world shortly after I had entered it.

{"id": 180, "text": "Many a morning and evening\n found Mother and me meditating before an improvised shrine, offering flowers dipped in fragrant sandalwood paste. With frankincense and myrrh as well as our united devotions, we honoured the divinity that had found full expression in Lahiri Mahasaya."}
{"id": 181, "text": "His picture had a surpassing influence over my life. As I grew, the thought of the master grew with me. In meditation I would often see his photographic image emerge from its small frame and, taking a living form, sit before me."}
{"id": 182, "text": "When I attempted to touch the feet of his luminous body, it would change and again become the picture. As childhood slipped into boyhood, I found Lahiri Mahasaya transformed in my mind from a little image, cribbed in a frame, to a living, enlightening presence."}
{"id": 183, "text": "I frequently prayed to him in moments of trial or confusion, finding within me his solacing direction. At first I grieved because he was no longer physically living. As I began to discover his secret omnipresence, I lamented no more."}
{"id": 184, "text": "He had often written to those of his disciples who were over-anxious to see him: “Why come to view my flesh and bones, when I am ever within range of your kutastha (spiritual sight)?”\nAt about the age of eight I was blessed with a wonderful healing through the photograph of Lahiri Mahasaya."}
{"id": 185, "text": "This experience gave intensification to my love. While at our family estate in Ichapur, Bengal, I was stricken with Asiatic cholera. My life was despaired of; the doctors could do nothing. At my bedside, Mother frantically motioned me to look at Lahiri Mahasaya’s picture on the wall above my head."}
{"id": 186, "text": "“Bow to him mentally!” She knew I was too feeble even to lift my hands in salutation. “If you really show your devotion and inwardly kneel before him, your life will be spared!”\nI gazed at his photograph and saw there a blinding light, enveloping my body and the entire room."}
{"id": 187, "text": "My nausea and other uncontrollable symptoms disappeared; I was well. At once I felt strong enough to bend over and touch Mother’s feet in appreciation of her immeasurable faith in her guru. Mother pressed her head repeatedly against the little picture."}
{"id": 188, "text": "“O Omnipresent Master, I thank thee that thy light hath healed my son!”\n I realized that she too had witnessed the luminous blaze through which I had instantly recovered from a usually fatal disease. One of my most precious possessions is that same photograph."}
{"id": 189, "text": "Given to Father by Lahiri Mahasaya himself, it carries a holy vibration. The picture had a miraculous origin. I heard the story from Father’s brother disciple, Kali Kumar Roy. It appears that the master had an aversion to being photographed."}
{"id": 190, "text": "Over his protest, a picture was once taken of him and a group of devotees, including Kali Kumar Roy."}
{"id": 191, "text": "It was an amazed photographer who discovered that the plate, which had clear images of all the disciples, revealed nothing more than a blank space in the centre where he had reasonably expected to find the outlines of Lahiri Mahasaya. The phenomenon was widely discussed."}
{"id": 192, "text": "A student who was an expert photographer, Ganga Dhar Babu, boasted that the fugitive figure would not escape him. The next morning, as the guru sat in lotus posture on a wooden bench with a screen behind him, Ganga Dhar Babu arrived with his equipment."}
{"id": 193, "text": "Taking every precaution for success, he greedily exposed twelve plates. On each one he soon found the imprint of the wooden bench and screen, but once again the master’s form was missing. With tears and shattered pride, Ganga Dhar Babu sought out his guru."}
{"id": 194, "text": "It was many hours before Lahiri Mahasaya broke his silence with a pregnant comment:\n“I am Spirit. Can your camera reflect the omnipresent Invisible?”\n“I see it cannot! But, Holy Sir, I lovingly desire a picture of your bodily temple."}
{"id": 195, "text": "My vision has been narrow; until today I did not realize that in you the Spirit fully dwells.”\n“Come, then, tomorrow morning. I will pose for you.”\nAgain the photographer focused his camera. This time the sacred figure, not cloaked with mysterious imperceptibility, was sharp on the plate."}
{"id": 196, "text": "The master never posed for another picture; at least, I have seen none. The photograph is reproduced in this book. 8 Lahiri Mahasaya’s fair features, of a universal cast, hardly suggest to what race he belonged. The\n joy of God-communion is slightly revealed in his enigmatic smile."}
{"id": 197, "text": "His eyes, half open to denote a nominal interest in the outer world, are also half closed, indicating his absorption in inner bliss. Oblivious of the poor lures of the earth, he was fully awake at all times to the spiritual problems of seekers who approached for his bounty."}
{"id": 198, "text": "Shortly after my healing through the potency of the guru’s picture, I had an influential spiritual vision. Sitting on my bed one morning, I fell into a deep reverie. “What is behind the darkness of closed eyes?” This probing thought came powerfully into my mind."}
{"id": 199, "text": "An immense flash of light at once manifested to my inner gaze. Divine shapes of saints, sitting in meditation posture in mountain caves, formed like miniature cinema pictures on the large screen of radiance within my forehead. Sri Yogananda at age six\n“Who are you?” I spoke aloud."}
{"id": 200, "text": "“We are the Himalayan yogis.” The celestial response is difficult to describe; my heart was thrilled. “Ah, I long to go to the Himalayas and become like you!” The vision vanished, but the silvery beams expanded in ever-widening circles to infinity. “What is this wondrous glow?”\n“I am Ishwara."}
{"id": 201, "text": "9 I am Light.” The Voice was as murmuring clouds. “I want to be one with Thee!”\nOut of the slow dwindling of my divine ecstasy, I salvaged a permanent legacy of inspiration to seek God. “He is eternal, ever-new Joy!” This memory persisted long after the day of rapture."}
{"id": 202, "text": "Another early recollection is outstanding; and literally so, for I bear the scar to this day. My elder sister Uma and I were seated in the early morning under a neem tree in our Gorakhpur compound."}
{"id": 203, "text": "She was helping me in my study of a Bengali primer, what time I could spare my gaze from the nearby parrots eating ripe margosa fruit. Uma complained of a boil on her leg, and fetched a jar of ointment. I smeared a bit of the salve on my forearm."}
{"id": 204, "text": "“Why do you use medicine on a healthy arm?”\n“Well, Sis, I feel I am going to have a boil tomorrow. I am testing your ointment on the spot where the boil will appear.”\n“You little liar!”\n“Sis, don’t call me a liar until you see what happens in the morning.” Indignation filled me."}
{"id": 205, "text": "Uma, unimpressed, thrice repeated her taunt. An adamant resolution sounded in my voice as I made slow reply."}
{"id": 206, "text": "“By the power of will in me, I say that tomorrow I shall have a fairly large boil in this exact place on my arm; and your boil shall swell to twice its present size!”\nMorning found me with a stalwart boil on the indicated spot; the dimensions of Uma’s boil had doubled."}
{"id": 207, "text": "With a shriek, my sister rushed to Mother. “Mukunda has become a necromancer!” Gravely, Mother instructed me never to use the power of words for doing harm. I have always remembered her counsel, and followed it. My boil was surgically treated."}
{"id": 208, "text": "A noticeable scar, left by the doctor’s incision, is present today. On my right forearm is a constant reminder of the power in man’s sheer word."}
{"id": 209, "text": "Those simple and apparently harmless phrases to Uma, spoken with deep concentration, had possessed sufficient hidden force to explode like bombs and to produce definite, though injurious, effects."}
{"id": 210, "text": "I understood later that the explosive vibratory power in speech could be wisely directed to free one’s life from difficulties and thus operate without scar or rebuke. 10\nOur family moved to Lahore in the Punjab. There I acquired a picture of the Divine Mother in the form of the Goddess Kali."}
{"id": 211, "text": "11 It sanctified a small informal shrine on the balcony of our home. An unequivocal conviction came over me that fulfilment would crown any of my prayers uttered in that sacred spot."}
{"id": 212, "text": "Standing there with Uma one day, I watched two boys flying kites over the roofs of two buildings that were separated from our house by an extremely narrow lane. “Why are you so quiet?” Uma pushed me playfully."}
{"id": 213, "text": "“I am just thinking how wonderful it is that Divine Mother gives me whatever I ask.”\n“I suppose She would give you those two kites!” My sister laughed derisively. “Why not?” I began silent prayers for their possession."}
{"id": 214, "text": "Matches are played in India with kites whose strings are covered with glue and ground glass. Each player attempts to sever the string held by his opponent. A freed kite sails over the roofs; there is great fun in catching it."}
{"id": 215, "text": "As Uma and I were on a roofed, recessed balcony, it seemed impossible that a loosed kite could come into our hands; its string would naturally dangle over the roof.

{"id": 398, "text": "My saintly guide raised his hand in blessing and slowly departed. “That sadhu is just as crazy as you are.” It was the hoary-headed pundit who made this charming observation. He and his son were gazing at me lugubriously."}

{"id": 602, "text": "Was it Bhaduri Mahasaya, of Upper Circular Road?”\nUpendra nodded, a little crestfallen not to be a news-bearer. My inquisitiveness about saints was well known to my friends; they delighted in setting me on a fresh track."}
{"id": 603, "text": "“The yogi lives so close to my home that I often visit him.” My words brought keen interest to Upendra’s face, and I made a further confidence. “I have seen him in remarkable feats.

{"id": 616, "text": "With the good-humoured wit that I found so delightful in his grave nature, he remarked, “People in general are more fond of Jala Yoga (union with food) than of Dhyana Yoga (union with God).”\nHis yogic pun affected me uproariously. “What a laugh you have!” An affectionate gleam came into his gaze."}

{"id": 623, "text": "Like a peaceful flood he swept away the mental debris of his listeners, floating them Godward. His striking parables were expressed in a flawless Bengali.

{"id": 627, "text": "Several students put rupees in Bhaduri’s slippers, which lay by his side as he sat in yoga posture.

{"id": 628, "text": "“Master, you are wonderful!” A student, taking his leave, gazed ardently at the patriarchal sage."}
{"id": 629, "text": "“You have renounced riches and comforts to seek God and teach us wisdom!” It was well known that Bhaduri Mahasaya had forsaken great family wealth in his early childhood, when single-mindedly he had entered the yogic path. “You are reversing the case!” The saint’s face held a mild rebuke."}
{"id": 630, "text": "“I have left a few paltry rupees, a few petty pleasures, for a cosmic empire of\n endless bliss. How then have I denied myself anything? I know the joy of sharing the treasure."}

{"id": 912, "text": "Grateful memories flashed of the Instant Beneficence: my healing of deadly cholera through an appeal to Lahiri Mahasaya’s picture; the playful gift of the two kites on the Lahore roof; the opportune amulet amidst my discouragement in Bareilly; the decisive message through the sadhu outside the courtyard of the pundit’s house in Banaras; the vision of Divine Mother and Her majestic words of love; Her swift heed through Master Mahasaya to my trifling embarrassments; the last-minute guidance that had materialised my high school diploma; and the ultimate boon, my living Master from the mist of my lifelong dreams."}

{"id": 914, "text": "“You must go along—as a witness and, very likely, a fellow victim!”\nA half hour later Jitendra and I were in possession of one-way tickets for the trip. We submitted, in a secluded corner of the station, to a search of our persons."}
{"id": 915, "text": "Ananta was quickly satisfied that we were carrying no hidden hoard; our simple dhotis concealed nothing more than was necessary. As faith invaded the serious realms of finance, my friend spoke protestingly. “Ananta, give me one or two rupees as a safeguard."}

{"id": 917, "text": "“Mukunda, I am not heartless.” A hint of humility had crept into Ananta’s voice. It may be that his conscience was smiting him: perhaps for sending two penniless boys to a strange city; perhaps for his own religious scepticism."}

{"id": 923, "text": "“Young lads, do you have friends in Brindaban?” The stranger opposite me was taking a surprising interest. “None of your business!” Rudely I averted my gaze. “You are probably flying away from your families under the enchantment of the Stealer of Hearts. 2 I am of devotional temperament myself."}
{"id": 924, "text": "I will make it my positive duty to see that you receive food, and shelter from this overpowering heat.”\n“No, sir, let us alone. You are very kind; but you are mistaken in judging us to be truants from home.”\nNo further conversation ensued; the train came to a halt."}

{"id": 939, "text": "Permit me to be your host and guide.”\nIt is scarcely possible for an Indian to pale, but Jitendra’s face was suddenly sickly. I politely declined the offer. “You are surely not banishing me?” The stranger’s alarm would have been comic in any other circumstances."}
{"id": 940, "text": "“Why not?”\n“You are my guru.” His eyes sought mine trustfully. “During my midday devotions, the blessed Lord Krishna appeared in a vision. He showed me two forsaken figures under this very tree. One face was yours, my master! Often have I seen it in meditation."}
{"id": 941, "text": "What joy if you accept my humble services!”\n“I too am glad you have found me. Neither God nor man has forsaken us!” Though I was motionless, smiling at the eager face before me, an inward obeisance cast me at the Divine Feet."}

{"id": 972, "text": "“Come, I will show you the hermitage.” Master rose from his tiger mat. In glancing about I noticed, on a wall, a picture that was garlanded with a spray of jasmine. “Lahiri Mahasaya!” I said in astonishment. “Yes, my divine guru.” Sri Yukteswar’s tone was reverently vibrant."}
{"id": 973, "text": "“Greater he was, as man and yogi, than any other teacher whose life came within the range of my investigations.”\nSilently I bowed before the familiar picture. Soul homage sped to the peerless master who, blessing my infancy, had guided my steps to this hour."}

{"id": 976, "text": "A spacious ground-floor hall, with high ceiling supported by colonnades, was used, Master said, chiefly during the annual festivities of Durgapuja . A narrow stairway led to Sri Yukteswar’s sitting room, whose small balcony overlooked the street."}
{"id": 977, "text": "The ashram was plainly furnished; everything was simple, clean, and utilitarian. Several Western-style chairs,\nbenches, and tables were in evidence. Master invited me to stay overnight. A supper of vegetable curry was served by two young disciples who were receiving hermitage training."}
{"id": 978, "text": "“Guruji, please tell me something of your life.” I was squatting on a straw mat near his tiger skin. The friendly stars were very close, it seemed, beyond the balcony. “My family name was Priya Nath Karar. I was born 1 here in Serampore, where Father was a wealthy businessman."}
{"id": 979, "text": "He left me this ancestral\n mansion, now my hermitage. My formal schooling was little; I found it slow and shallow. In early manhood, I undertook the responsibilities of a householder, and have one daughter, now married. My middle life was blessed with the guidance of Lahiri Mahasaya."}
{"id": 980, "text": "After my wife died, I joined the Swami Order and received the new name of Sri Yukteswar Giri. 2 Such are my simple annals.”\nMaster smiled at my eager face. Like all biographical sketches, his words had given the outward facts without revealing the inner man."}
{"id": 981, "text": "“Guruji, I would like to hear some stories of your childhood.”\n“I will tell you a few—each one with a moral!” Sri Yukteswar’s eyes twinkled with his warning. “My mother once tried to frighten me with an appalling story of a ghost in a dark chamber."}
{"id": 982, "text": "I went there immediately, and expressed my disappointment at having missed the ghost. Mother never told me another horror tale. Moral: Look fear in the face and it will cease to trouble you. “Another early memory is my wish for an ugly dog belonging to a neighbour."}

{"id": 984, "text": "I heard my mother remark occasionally: ‘A man who accepts a job under anyone is a slave.’ That impression became so indelibly fixed that even after my marriage I refused all positions. I met expenses by investing my family endowment in land."}
{"id": 985, "text": "Moral: Good and positive suggestions should instruct the sensitive ears of children. Their early ideas long remain sharply etched.”\nMaster fell into tranquil silence. Around midnight he led me to a narrow cot. Sleep was sound and sweet the first night under my guru’s roof."}

{"id": 991, "text": "Your master has proved to be no inaccessible Himalayan saint, but one nearby.

{"id": 994, "text": "Daily life at the ashram flowed smoothly, infrequently varied. My guru awoke before dawn. Lying down, or sometimes sitting on the bed, he entered a state of samadhi . 3 It was simplicity itself to discover when Master had awakened: abrupt halt of stupendous snores."}
{"id": 995, "text": "4 A sigh or two; perhaps a bodily movement. Then a soundless state of breathlessness: he was in deep yogic joy. Breakfast did not follow; first came a long walk by the Ganges."}
{"id": 996, "text": "Those morning strolls with my guru—how real and vivid still! In the easy resurrection of memory, I often find myself by his side. The early sun is warming the river; his voice rings out, rich with the authenticity of wisdom. A bath, then the midday meal."}
{"id": 997, "text": "Its preparation, according to Master’s daily directions, had been the careful task of young disciples. My guru was a vegetarian. Before embracing monkhood, however, he had eaten eggs and fish. His advice to students was to follow any simple diet which proved\nsuited to one’s constitution."}
{"id": 998, "text": "Master ate little; often rice, coloured with turmeric or juice of beets or spinach and lightly sprinkled with buffalo ghee or melted butter. Another day he might have lentil-dal or channa 5 curry with vegetables. For dessert, mangoes or oranges with rice pudding, or jackfruit juice."}
{"id": 999, "text": "Visitors appeared in the afternoons. A steady stream poured from the world into the tranquil hermitage. My guru treated all guests with courtesy and kindness. A master—one who has realized himself as the omnipresent soul, not the body or the ego—perceives in all men a striking similarity."}
{"id": 1000, "text": "The impartiality of saints is rooted in wisdom. They are no longer influenced by the alternating faces of maya , no longer subject to the likes and dislikes that confuse the judgment of unenlightened men."}
{"id": 1001, "text": "Sri Yukteswar showed no special consideration to those who were powerful, rich, or accomplished; neither did he slight others for their poverty or illiteracy. He would listen respectfully to words of truth from a child; and, on occasion, would openly ignore a conceited pundit."}
{"id": 1002, "text": "Eight o’clock was the supper hour, and sometimes found lingering guests. My guru would not excuse himself to eat alone; none left his ashram hungry or dissatisfied."}
{"id": 1003, "text": "Sri Yukteswar was never at a loss, never dismayed by unexpected visitors; under his resourceful directions to the disciples, scanty food would emerge a banquet. Yet he was economical; his modest funds went far. “Be comfortable within your purse,” he often said."}
{"id": 1004, "text": "“Extravagance will bring you discomfort.” Whether in the details of hermitage entertainment or of building and repair work or of other practical concerns, Master manifested the originality of a creative spirit. Quiet evening hours often brought one of my guru’s discourses: treasures against time."}
{"id": 1005, "text": "His every utterance was chiselled by wisdom. A sublime self- assurance marked his mode of expression: it was unique. He spoke as none other in my experience ever spoke. His thoughts were weighed in a delicate balance of discrimination before he permitted them the outward garb of speech."}
{"id": 1006, "text": "The essence of truth, all-pervasive with even a physiological aspect, came from him like a fragrant exudation of the soul. I was conscious always that I was in the presence of a living manifestation of God. The weight of his divinity automatically bowed my head before him."}
{"id": 1007, "text": "If guests detected that Sri Yukteswar was becoming engrossed with the Infinite, he quickly engaged them in conversation. He was incapable of striking a pose or of flaunting his inner withdrawal. Always one with the Lord, he needed no separate time for communion."}
{"id": 1008, "text": "A Self-realized master has already left behind the steppingstone of meditation. “The flower falls when the fruit appears.” But saints often cling to spiritual forms in order to set an example for disciples. As midnight approached, my guru might fall into a doze with the naturalness of a child."}
{"id": 1009, "text": "There was no fuss about bedding. He often lay down, without even a pillow, on a narrow davenport which was the background for his customary tiger-skin seat. A night-long philosophical discussion was not rare; any disciple could summon it by intensity of interest."}
{"id": 1010, "text": "I felt no tiredness then, no desire for sleep; Master’s living words were sufficient. “Oh, it is dawn! Let us walk by the Ganges.” So ended many of my periods of nocturnal edification."}
{"id": 1011, "text": "My early months with Sri Yukteswar culminated in a useful lesson: “How to Outwit a Mosquito.” At home my family always used protective curtains at night. I was dismayed to discover that in the Serampore hermitage this prudent custom was honoured in the breach."}
{"id": 1012, "text": "Yet the insects were in full residence; I was bitten from head to foot. My guru took pity on me. “Buy yourself a curtain, and also one for me.” He laughed and added, “If you buy only one, for yourself, all mosquitoes will concentrate on me!”\nI was more than thankful to comply."}
{"id": 1013, "text": "On every night that I spent in Serampore, my guru would ask me to arrange the bedtime curtains. One night, when a cloud of mosquitoes surrounded us, Master failed to issue his usual instructions. I listened nervously to the anticipatory hum of the insects."}
{"id": 1014, "text": "Getting into bed, I threw a propitiatory prayer in their general direction. A half hour later, I coughed pretentiously to attract my guru’s attention. I thought I would go mad with the bites and especially the singing drone as the mosquitoes celebrated bloodthirsty rites."}
{"id": 1015, "text": "No responsive stir from Master; I approached him cautiously. He was not breathing. This was my first close observation of him in the yogic trance; it filled me with fright. “His heart must have failed!” I placed a mirror under his nose; no breath vapour appeared."}
{"id": 1016, "text": "To make doubly certain, for minutes I closed his mouth and nostrils with my fingers. His body was cold and motionless. In a daze, I turned toward the door to summon help. “So! A budding experimentalist! My poor nose!” Master’s voice was shaky with laughter."}
{"id": 1017, "text": "“Why don’t you go to bed? Is the whole world going to change for you? Change yourself: be rid of the mosquito consciousness.”\nMeekly I returned to my bed. Not one insect ventured near. I realized that my guru had previously agreed to the curtains only to please me; he had had no fear of mosquitoes."}
{"id": 1018, "text": "By yogic power he could prevent them from biting him; or, if he chose, he could escape to an inner invulnerability. “He was giving me a demonstration,” I thought."}
{"id": 1019, "text": "“That is the yogic state I must strive to attain.” A true yogi is able to pass into and maintain the superconscious state, regardless of multitudinous distractions never absent from this earth—the buzz of insects! the pervasive glare of daylight! In the first state of samadhi (sabikalpa ), the devotee shuts off all sensory testimony of the outer world."}
{"id": 1020, "text": "He is rewarded then by sounds and scenes of inner realms fairer than the pristine Eden. 6\nThe instructive mosquitoes served for another early lesson at the ashram. It was the gentle hour of dusk. My guru was matchlessly interpreting the ancient texts. At his feet, I was in perfect peace."}
{"id": 1021, "text": "A rude mosquito entered the idyll and competed for my attention. As it dug a poisonous “hypodermic needle” into my thigh, I automatically raised an avenging hand.

Do you advocate taking life?”\n“No, but in your mind you had already struck the deathblow.” “I don’t understand.”\n“By ahimsa Patanjali meant removal of the desire to kill.” Sri Yukteswar had found my mental processes an open book."}
{"id": 1023, "text": "“This world is inconveniently arranged for a literal practice of ahimsa . Man may be compelled to exterminate harmful creatures. He is not under a similar compulsion to feel anger or animosity. All forms of life have an equal right to the air of maya ."}
{"id": 1024, "text": "The saint who uncovers the secret of creation will be in harmony with Nature’s countless bewildering expressions. All men may understand this truth by overcoming the passion for destruction.”\n“Guruji, should one offer himself a sacrifice rather than kill a wild beast?”\n“No, man’s body is precious."}
{"id": 1025, "text": "It has the highest evolutionary value because of unique brain and spinal centres. These enable the advanced devotee fully to grasp and express the loftiest aspects of divinity. No lower form is so equipped."}
{"id": 1026, "text": "It is true that a man incurs the debt of a minor sin if he is forced to kill an animal or any other living thing."}
{"id": 1027, "text": "But the holy shastras teach that wanton loss of a human body is a serious transgression against the karmic law.”\nI sighed in relief; scriptural reinforcement of one’s natural instincts is not always forthcoming. Master, so far as I know, was never at close quarters with a leopard or a tiger."}
{"id": 1028, "text": "But a deadly cobra once confronted him, only to be conquered by his love. The encounter took place in Puri, where my guru had a seaside hermitage. Prafulla, a young disciple of Sri Yukteswar’s later years, was with Master on this occasion. “We were seated outdoors near the ashram,” Prafulla told me."}
{"id": 1029, "text": "“A cobra appeared nearby, a four-foot length of sheer terror. Its hood was angrily expanded as it raced toward us. Master gave a welcoming chuckle, as\n though to a child. I was filled with consternation to see Sri Yukteswarji engage in a rhythmical clapping of hands."}
{"id": 1030, "text": "8 He was entertaining the dread visitor! I remained completely quiet, inwardly ejaculating fervent prayers. The serpent, very close to Master, was now motionless, seemingly magnetised by his caressing attitude."}
{"id": 1031, "text": "The frightful hood gradually contracted; the snake slithered between Sri Yukteswarji’s feet and disappeared into the bushes. “Why Master would move his hands and why the cobra would not strike them were inexplicable to me then,” Prafulla concluded."}
{"id": 1032, "text": "“I have since come to realize that our divine guru is beyond fear of hurt from any creature.”\nOne afternoon during my early months at the ashram, I found Sri Yukteswar’s eyes fixed on me piercingly."}
{"id": 1033, "text": "“You are too thin, Mukunda.”\nHis remark struck a sensitive point; my sunken eyes and emaciated appearance were not to my liking. Chronic dyspepsia had afflicted me since childhood. Many bottles of tonics stood on a shelf in my room at home; none had helped me."}
{"id": 1034, "text": "Occasionally I would sadly ask myself if life were worthwhile with a body so unsound. “Medicines have limitations; the divine creative life force has none. Believe that: you shall be well and strong.”\nMaster’s words instantly convinced me that I could successfully apply their truth in my own life."}
{"id": 1035, "text": "No other healer (and I had tried many) had been able to arouse in me such profound faith. Day by day I waxed in health and strength. Through Sri Yukteswar’s hidden blessing, in two weeks I gained the weight that I had vainly sought in the past. My stomach ailments vanished permanently."}
{"id": 1036, "text": "On later occasions I was privileged to witness my guru’s divine healings of persons suffering from diabetes, epilepsy, tuberculosis, or paralysis. “Years ago, I, too, was anxious to put on weight,” Master told me shortly after he had healed me."}
{"id": 1037, "text": "“During convalescence after a severe illness, I visited Lahiri Mahasaya in Banaras. “‘Sir,’ I said, ‘I have been very sick and have lost many pounds.’"}
{"id": 1038, "text": "“‘I see, Yukteswar, 9 you made yourself unwell, and now you think you are thin.’\n“This reply was far from the one I had expected; my guru, however, added encouragingly:\n“‘Let me see; I am sure you ought to feel better tomorrow.’\n“My receptive mind accepted his words as a hint that he was secretly healing me."}
{"id": 1039, "text": "The next morning I sought him out and exclaimed exultingly, ‘Sir, I feel much better today.’\n“‘Indeed! Today you invigorate yourself.’\n“‘No, Master!’ I protested. ‘It is you who have helped me; this is the first time in weeks that I have had any energy.’\n“‘Oh, yes! Your malady has been quite serious."}
{"id": 1040, "text": "Your body is frail yet; who can say how it will be tomorrow?’\n“The thought of a possible return of my weakness brought me a shudder of cold fear. The following morning I could hardly drag myself to Lahiri Mahasaya’s home. “‘Sir, I am ailing again.’\n“My guru’s glance was quizzical."}
{"id": 1041, "text": "‘So! Once more you indispose yourself.’\n“My patience was exhausted. ‘Gurudeva,’ I said, ‘I realize now that day by day you have been ridiculing me."}
{"id": 1042, "text": "I don’t understand why you disbelieve my truthful reports.’\n“‘Really, it has been your thoughts that have made you feel alternately weak and strong.’ My guru looked at me affectionately. ‘You have seen how your health has exactly followed your subconscious expectations."}
{"id": 1043, "text": "Thought is a force, even as electricity or gravitation. The human mind is a spark of the almighty consciousness of God."}
{"id": 1044, "text": "I could show you that whatever your powerful mind believes very intensely would instantly come to pass.’\n“Knowing that Lahiri Mahasaya never spoke idly, I addressed him with great awe and gratitude: ‘Master, if I think that I am well and that I have regained my former weight, shall those things come to pass?’\n“‘It is so, even at this moment.’ My guru spoke gravely, his gaze concentrated on my eyes."}
{"id": 1045, "text": "“I instantly felt an increase not only of strength but of weight. Lahiri Mahasaya retreated into silence. After a few hours at his feet, I returned to my mother’s house, where I stayed during my visits to Banaras."}
{"id": 1046, "text": "“‘My son! What is the matter? Are you swelling with dropsy?’ Mother could hardly believe her eyes. My body was now as full and robust as it had been before my illness. “I weighed myself and found that in one day I had gained fifty pounds; they have remained permanently."}
{"id": 1047, "text": "Friends and acquaintances who had seen my thin figure were overcome with amazement. A number of them changed their mode of life and became disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya as a result of this miracle. “My guru, awake in God, knew this world to be nothing but an objectivised dream of the Creator."}
{"id": 1048, "text": "Because he was completely aware of his unity with the Divine Dreamer, Lahiri Mahasaya could materialise or dematerialise or make any other change he wished in the dream atoms of the phenomenal world. 10\n“All creation is governed by law,” Sri Yukteswar concluded."}
{"id": 1049, "text": "“The principles that operate in the outer universe, discoverable by scientists, are called natural laws. But there are subtler laws that rule the hidden spiritual planes and the inner realm of consciousness; these principles are knowable through the science of yoga."}
{"id": 1050, "text": "It is not the physicist but the Self-realized master who comprehends the true nature of matter. By such knowledge Christ was able to restore the servant’s ear after it had been severed by one of the disciples.” 11\nMy guru was a peerless interpreter of the scriptures."}
{"id": 1051, "text": "Many of my happiest memories are centred in his discourses. But his jewelled thoughts were not cast into the ashes of heedlessness or stupidity. One restless movement of my body, or my slight lapse into absentmindedness, would suffice to put an abrupt period to Master’s exposition."}
{"id": 1052, "text": "“You are not here.” Sri Yukteswar interrupted himself one afternoon with this observation. As usual, he was keeping relentless track of my attention. “Guruji!” My tone was a protest. “I have not stirred; my eyelids have not moved; I can repeat each word you have uttered!”"}
{"id": 1053, "text": "“Nevertheless you were not fully with me. Your objection forces me to remark that in your mental background you were creating three institutions."}
{"id": 1054, "text": "One was a sylvan retreat on a plain, another on a hilltop, still another by the ocean.”\nThose vaguely formulated thoughts had indeed been present almost subconsciously. I glanced at him apologetically."}
{"id": 1055, "text": "“What can I do with such a master—one who penetrates my random musings?”\n“You have given me that right. The subtle truths I am expounding cannot be grasped without your complete concentration. Unless necessary I do not invade the seclusion of others’ minds."}
{"id": 1056, "text": "Man has the natural privilege of roaming secretly among his thoughts. The unbidden Lord does not enter there; neither do I venture intrusion.”\n“You are ever welcome, Master!”\n“Your architectural dreams will materialise later."}
{"id": 1057, "text": "Now is the time for study!”\nThus incidentally, in his simple way, my guru revealed his knowledge of the coming of three important events in my life. Since early youth I had had enigmatic glimpses of three buildings, each in a different setting."}
{"id": 1058, "text": "In the exact sequence Sri Yukteswar had indicated, these visions took ultimate form. First came my founding of a boys’ yoga school on a plain in Ranchi, then an American headquarters on a Los Angeles hilltop, and then a hermitage in Encinitas, California, overlooking the vast Pacific."}
{"id": 1059, "text": "Master never arrogantly said: “I prophesy that such and such an event shall occur!” He would rather hint: “Don’t you think it may happen?” But his simple speech hid vatic power. There was no recanting; never did his slightly veiled predictions prove false."}
{"id": 1060, "text": "Sri Yukteswar was reserved and matter-of-fact in demeanour. There was naught of the vague or daft visionary about him. His feet were firm on the earth, his head in the haven of heaven. Practical people aroused his admiration."}
{"id": 1061, "text": "“Saintliness is not dumbness! Divine perceptions are not incapacitating!” he would say. “The active expression of virtue gives rise to the keenest intelligence.”\n My guru was reluctant to discuss the superphysical realms. His only “marvellous” aura was that of perfect simplicity."}
{"id": 1062, "text": "In conversation he avoided startling references; in action he was freely expressive. Many teachers talked of miracles but could manifest nothing; Sri Yukteswar seldom mentioned the subtle laws but secretly operated them at will."}
{"id": 1063, "text": "“A man of realization does not perform any miracle until he receives an inward sanction,” Master explained. “God does not wish the secrets of His creation revealed promiscuously. 12 Also, every individual in the world has an inalienable right to his free will."}
{"id": 1064, "text": "A saint will not encroach on that independence.”\nThe silence habitual to Sri Yukteswar was caused by his deep perceptions of the Infinite. No time remained for the interminable “revelations” that occupy the days of teachers without Self-realization."}
{"id": 1065, "text": "A saying from the Hindu scriptures is: “In shallow men the fish of little thoughts cause much commotion. In oceanic minds the whales of inspiration make hardly a ruffle.”\nBecause of my guru’s unspectacular guise, only a few of his contemporaries recognised him as a superman."}
{"id": 1066, "text": "The adage: “He is a fool that cannot conceal his wisdom,” could never be applied to my profound and quiet master. Though born a mortal like all others, Sri Yukteswar achieved identity with the Ruler of time and space. Master found no insuperable obstacle to the mergence of human and Divine."}
{"id": 1067, "text": "No such barrier exists, I came to understand, save in man’s spiritual unadventurousness. I always thrilled at the touch of Sri Yukteswar’s holy feet. A disciple is spiritually magnetised by reverent contact with a master; a subtle current is generated."}
{"id": 1068, "text": "The devotee’s undesirable habit-mechanisms in the brain are often as if cauterised; the grooves of his worldly tendencies are beneficially disturbed. Momentarily at least he may find the secret veils of maya lifting, and glimpse the reality of bliss."}
{"id": 1069, "text": "My whole body responded with a liberating glow whenever I knelt in the Indian fashion before my guru. “Even when Lahiri Mahasaya was silent,” Master told me, “or when he conversed  on  other  than  strictly  religious  topics,  I  discovered  that"}
{"id": 1070, "text": "nonetheless he had transmitted to me ineffable knowledge.”\nSri Yukteswar affected me similarly. If I entered the hermitage in a worried or indifferent frame of mind, my attitude imperceptibly changed. A healing calm descended at the mere sight of my guru."}
{"id": 1071, "text": "Each day with him was a new experience in joy, peace, and wisdom. Never did I find him deluded or emotionally intoxicated with greed, anger, or human attachment. “The darkness of maya is silently approaching."}
{"id": 1072, "text": "Let us hie homeward within.” With these cautionary words Master constantly reminded his disciples of their need for Kriya Yoga . A new student occasionally\nexpressed doubts regarding his own worthiness to engage in yoga practice. “Forget the past,” Sri Yukteswar would console him."}
{"id": 1073, "text": "“The vanished lives\nof all men are dark with many shames. Human conduct is ever unreliable until man is anchored in the Divine. Everything in future will improve if you are making a spiritual effort now.”\nMaster always had young chelas (disciples) in his ashram."}
{"id": 1074, "text": "Their intellectual and spiritual education was his lifelong interest. Even shortly before he passed on, he accepted, as hermitage residents, two six-year-old boys and a youth of sixteen."}
{"id": 1075, "text": "All those in his charge were carefully trained; “disciple” and “discipline” are etymologically and practically related. The ashram residents loved and revered their guru; a slight clap of his hands sufficed to bring them eagerly to his side."}
{"id": 1076, "text": "When his mood was silent and withdrawn, no one ventured to speak; when his laugh rang jovially, children looked upon him as their own. Sri Yukteswar seldom asked others to render him a personal service, nor would he accept a chela’s help unless it was offered cheerfully."}
{"id": 1077, "text": "Master himself would wash his clothes if the disciples forgot the privileged task. His usual garment was the traditional ochre-coloured swami robe. For indoor use he wore laceless shoes that had been made, in accordance with yogi-custom, of tiger or deer skin."}
{"id": 1078, "text": "Sri Yukteswar spoke fluent English, French, Bengali, and Hindi; his Sanskrit was fair. He patiently instructed his young disciples by certain shortcuts that he had ingeniously devised for the study of English and Sanskrit. Master was not solicitously attached to his body, but he was cautious of it."}
{"id": 1079, "text": "The Divine, he pointed out, is properly manifested through physical and mental soundness. He discountenanced all extremes. To a disciple who wanted to fast for a long period, my guru said laughingly, “Why not throw the dog a bone?” 13\nSri Yukteswar’s health was excellent; I never saw him unwell."}
{"id": 1080, "text": "14 To show respect for a worldly custom he permitted his students, if they wished, to consult doctors."}
{"id": 1081, "text": "“Physicians,” he said, “should carry on their work of healing through God’s laws as applied to matter.” But he extolled the superiority of mental therapy, and often repeated: “Wisdom is the greatest cleanser.” He told his chelas:\n“The body is a treacherous friend. Give it its due; no more."}
{"id": 1082, "text": "Pain and pleasure are transitory; endure all dualities with calmness, trying at the same time to remove yourself beyond their power. Imagination is the door through which disease as well as healing enters."}
{"id": 1083, "text": "Disbelieve in the reality of sickness even when you are ill; an unrecognised visitor will flee!”\nMaster numbered many doctors among his disciples. “Those who have studied physiology should go further and investigate the science of the soul,” he told them."}
{"id": 1084, "text": "“A subtle spiritual structure is hidden just behind the bodily mechanism.” 15\nSri Yukteswar counselled his students to be living liaisons of Western and Eastern virtues. Himself an executive Occidental in outer habits, inwardly he was the spiritual Oriental."}
{"id": 1085, "text": "He praised the progressive, resourceful, and hygienic ways of the West, and the religious ideals that give a centuried halo to the East. Discipline had not been unknown to me; at home Father was strict, Ananta often severe. But Sri Yukteswar’s training may not be described as other than drastic."}
{"id": 1086, "text": "A perfectionist, my guru was hypercritical of his disciples, whether in matters of moment or in the subtle nuances of ordinary behaviour. “Good manners without sincerity are like a beautiful dead lady,” he remarked on suitable occasion. “Straightforwardness without civility is like"}
{"id": 1087, "text": "a surgeon’s knife, effective but unpleasant. Candour with courtesy is helpful and admirable.”\nMaster was apparently satisfied with my spiritual progress, for he seldom referred to it; in other matters my ears were no strangers to reproof."}
{"id": 1088, "text": "My chief offences were absentmindedness, intermittent indulgence in sad moods, nonobservance of certain rules of etiquette, and occasional unmethodical ways. “Observe how the activities of your father Bhagabati are well organised and well balanced,” my guru pointed out."}
{"id": 1089, "text": "The two disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya had met, soon after my first visit to the Serampore hermitage. Father and Master deeply admired each other. Both had built a beautiful inner life on foundations of spiritual granite, insoluble against the ages."}
{"id": 1090, "text": "From a transient teacher of my earlier life I had imbibed a few erroneous lessons. A chela , I had been told, need not concern himself strenuously with worldly duties; when I had neglected or carelessly performed my tasks, I had not been chastised."}
{"id": 1091, "text": "Human nature finds such instruction very easy of assimilation. Under Master’s unsparing rod, however, I soon recovered from the agreeable delusions of irresponsibility. “Those who are too good for this world are adorning some other,” Sri Yukteswar remarked one day."}
{"id": 1092, "text": "“So long as you breathe the free air of earth, you are under obligation to render grateful service."}
{"id": 1093, "text": "Only he who has fully mastered the breathless state 16 is freed from cosmic imperatives.” He added dryly, “I shall not fail to let you know when you have attained the final perfection.”\nMy guru could not be bribed, even by love."}
{"id": 1094, "text": "He showed no leniency to anyone who, like myself, had willingly offered to become a disciple. Whether Master and I were surrounded by his students or by strangers, or were alone together, he always spoke plainly and upbraided sharply."}
{"id": 1095, "text": "No trifling lapse into shallowness or inconsistency escaped his rebuke. This flattening-to-the-ego treatment was hard to endure, but my unchangeable resolve was to allow Sri Yukteswar to iron out all of my psychological kinks."}
{"id": 1096, "text": "As he laboured at this titanic transformation, I shook many times under the weight of his disciplinary hammer. “If you don’t like my words, you are at liberty to leave at any time,” Master assured me. “I want nothing from you but your own improvement."}
{"id": 1097, "text": "Stay only if you feel benefited.”\nI am immeasurably grateful for the humbling blows he dealt my vanity. I sometimes felt that, metaphorically, he was discovering and uprooting every diseased tooth in my jaw. The hard core of egotism is difficult to dislodge except rudely."}
{"id": 1098, "text": "With its departure, the Divine finds at last an unobstructed channel. In vain It seeks to percolate through flinty hearts of selfishness. Sri Yukteswar’s intuition was penetrating; heedless of remarks, he often replied to one’s unexpressed thoughts."}
{"id": 1099, "text": "The words a person uses, and the actual thoughts behind them, may be poles apart. “By calmness,” my guru said, “try to feel the thoughts behind the confusion of men’s verbiage.”\nThe disclosures of divine insight are often painful to worldly ears; Master was not popular with superficial students."}
{"id": 1100, "text": "The wise, always few in number, deeply revered him. I daresay Sri Yukteswar would have been the most sought-after guru in India had his speech not been so candid and so censorious. “I am hard on those who come for my training,” he admitted to me. “That is my way."}
{"id": 1101, "text": "Take it or leave it; I never compromise. But you will be much kinder to your disciples; that is your way. I try to purify only in fires of severity; these are searing beyond the average toleration. The gentle approach of love is also transfiguring."}
{"id": 1102, "text": "The inflexible and the yielding methods are equally effective if applied with wisdom.” He added, “You will go to foreign lands, where blunt assaults on the ego are not appreciated."}
{"id": 1103, "text": "A teacher could not spread India’s message in the West without an ample fund of accommodative patience and forbearance.” (I refuse to say how often, in America, I have remembered Master’s words!)\nThough my guru’s undissembling speech prevented a large following during his years on earth, nevertheless, through an ever-growing number of sincere students of his teachings, his spirit lives on in the world today."}
{"id": 1104, "text": "Warriors like Alexander the Great seek sovereignty over the soil; masters like Sri Yukteswar win a farther dominion—in men’s souls. It was Master’s practice to point out the simple, negligible shortcomings of his disciples with an air of portentous gravity."}
{"id": 1105, "text": "One day my father visited Serampore to pay his respects to Sri Yukteswar. My parent expected, very likely, to hear some words in my praise. He was shocked to be given a long account of my imperfections. He rushed to see me."}
{"id": 1106, "text": "“From your guru’s remarks I thought to find you a complete wreck!” My parent was between tears and laughter. The only cause of Sri Yukteswar’s displeasure at the time was that I had been trying, against his gentle hint, to convert a certain man to the spiritual path."}
{"id": 1107, "text": "With indignant speed I sought out my guru. He received me with downcast eyes, as though conscious of guilt. It was the only time I ever saw the divine lion meek before me. The unique moment was savoured to the full."}
{"id": 1108, "text": "“Sir, why did you judge me so mercilessly before my astounded father?\nWas that just?”\n“I will not do it again.” Sri Yukteswar’s tone was apologetic. Instantly I was disarmed."}
{"id": 1109, "text": "How readily had the great man admitted a fault! Though he never again upset Father’s peace of mind, Master relentlessly continued to dissect me whenever and wherever he chose. New disciples often joined Sri Yukteswar in exhaustive criticism of others."}
{"id": 1110, "text": "Wise like the guru! Models of flawless discrimination! But he who takes the offensive should not be defenceless. The carping students themselves fled precipitantly as soon as Master publicly unloosed in their direction a few shafts from his analytical quiver."}
{"id": 1111, "text": "“Tender inner weaknesses, revolting at mild touches of censure, are like diseased parts of the body, recoiling before even delicate handling.” This was Sri Yukteswar’s amused comment on the flighty ones. Many disciples have a preconceived image of a guru, by which they judge his words and actions."}
{"id": 1112, "text": "Such persons often complained that they did not understand Sri Yukteswar. “Neither do you understand God!” I retorted on one occasion. “If a saint were clear to you, you would be one!” Among the trillion mysteries,"}
{"id": 1113, "text": "breathing every second the inexplicable air, may one venture to ask that the fathomless nature of a master be instantly grasped?\nStudents came, and generally went. Those who craved an easy path—that of instant sympathy and comforting recognitions of one’s merits—did not find it at the hermitage."}
{"id": 1114, "text": "Master offered his disciples shelter and shepherding for the aeons, but many students miserly demanded ego-balm as well. They departed; preferring, before any humility, life’s countless humiliations."}
{"id": 1115, "text": "Sri Yukteswar’s blazing rays, the open penetrating sunshine of his wisdom, were too powerful for their spiritual sickness. They sought out some lesser teacher, who, shading them with flattery, permitted the fitful sleep of ignorance."}
{"id": 1116, "text": "During my early months with Master I experienced a sensitive fear of his reprimands. I soon saw that his verbal vivisections were performed only on persons who, like myself, had asked him to discipline them. If any writhing student made a protest, Sri Yukteswar, unoffended, would fall into silence."}
{"id": 1117, "text": "His words were never wrathful, but impersonal with wisdom. Master’s rebukes were not aimed at casual visitors; he seldom remarked on their defects, even if conspicuous. But toward students who sought his counsel, Sri Yukteswar felt a serious responsibility."}
{"id": 1118, "text": "Brave indeed is the guru who undertakes to transform the crude ore of ego-permeated humanity! A saint’s courage is rooted in his compassion for maya -bewildered men, the stumbling eyeless of the world. After I had abandoned underlying resentment, I found a marked decrease in my chastisement."}
{"id": 1119, "text": "In a very subtle way, Master melted into comparative clemency. In time I demolished every wall of rationalisation and subconscious 17 reservation behind which the human personality generally shields itself. The reward was an effortless harmony with my guru."}
{"id": 1120, "text": "I discovered him then to be trusting, considerate, and silently loving. Undemonstrative, however, he bestowed no word of affection. My own temperament is principally devotional."}
{"id": 1121, "text": "It was disconcerting at first to find that my guru, saturated with jnana but seemingly dry of bhakti , 18 expressed himself chiefly in terms of cold spiritual mathematics. But, as I attuned myself to his nature, I discovered no diminution but rather an\n increase in my devotional approach to God."}
{"id": 1122, "text": "A Self-realized master is fully able to guide his various disciples along the natural lines of their essential bias. My relationship with Sri Yukteswar was somewhat inarticulate, yet possessed a hidden eloquence. Often I found his silent signature on my thoughts, rendering speech inutile."}
{"id": 1123, "text": "Quietly sitting beside him, I would feel his bounty pouring peacefully over my being. Master’s impartial justice was notably demonstrated during the summer vacation of my first college year. I had been looking forward to uninterrupted months in Serampore with my guru."}
{"id": 1124, "text": "“You may be in charge of the hermitage.” Sri Yukteswar was pleased over my enthusiastic arrival. “Your duties will be the reception of guests, and supervision of the work of the other disciples.”\nKumar, a young villager from east Bengal, was accepted a fortnight later for ashram training."}
{"id": 1125, "text": "Remarkably intelligent, he quickly won Master’s affection. For some unfathomable reason, Sri Yukteswar adopted an uncritical attitude toward the new resident. “Mukunda, let Kumar assume your duties."}
{"id": 1126, "text": "Employ your own time in sweeping and cooking.” Master issued these instructions after the new boy had been with us for a month. Exalted to leadership, Kumar exercised a petty house-hold tyranny. In silent mutiny, the other disciples continued to seek me out for daily counsel."}
{"id": 1127, "text": "This situation continued for three weeks; then I overheard a conversation between Kumar and Master. “Mukunda is impossible!” the boy said."}
{"id": 1128, "text": "“You made me supervisor, yet the others go to him and obey him.”\n“That’s why I assigned him to the kitchen and you to the parlour—so you might come to realize that a worthy leader has the desire to serve, not to dominate.” Sri Yukteswar’s withering tones were new to Kumar."}
{"id": 1129, "text": "“You wanted Mukunda’s position, but could not maintain it by merit. Return now to your earlier work as cook’s assistant.”\nAfter this humbling incident, Master resumed toward Kumar a former attitude of unwonted indulgence. Who may solve the mystery of attraction?"}
{"id": 1130, "text": "In Kumar our guru discovered a charming fount—one, however, that did not spurt for the fellow disciples. Though the new boy was obviously Sri Yukteswar’s favourite, I felt no dismay. Personal idiosyncrasies, possessed even by masters, lend a rich complexity to the pattern of life."}
{"id": 1131, "text": "My nature is seldom commandeered by a detail; I was seeking from Sri Yukteswar a higher benefit than outward praise. Kumar spoke venomously to me one day without reason; I was deeply hurt."}
{"id": 1132, "text": "“Your head is swelling to the bursting point!” I added a warning whose truth I felt intuitively: “Unless you mend your ways, someday you will be asked to leave this ashram.”\nLaughing sarcastically, Kumar repeated my remark to our guru, who had just entered the room."}
{"id": 1133, "text": "Fully expecting to be scolded, I retired meekly to a corner. “Maybe Mukunda is right.” Master’s reply to the boy came with unusual coldness. A year later, Kumar set out for a visit to his childhood home."}
{"id": 1134, "text": "He ignored the quiet disapproval of Sri Yukteswar, who never authoritatively controlled his disciples’ movements. On the boy’s return to Serampore in a few months, a change was unpleasantly apparent. Gone was the stately Kumar with serenely glowing face."}
{"id": 1135, "text": "Only an undistinguished peasant stood before us, one who had lately acquired a number of evil habits. Master summoned me and brokenheartedly discussed the fact that the boy was now unsuited to the monastic hermitage life."}
{"id": 1136, "text": "“Mukunda, I will leave it to you to instruct Kumar to leave the ashram tomorrow; I can’t do it!” Tears stood in Sri Yukteswar’s eyes, but he controlled himself quickly. “The boy would never have fallen to these depths had he listened to me and not gone away to mix with undesirable companions."}

{"id": 1256, "text": "“Are you able to have a little room where you can close the door and be alone?”\n“Yes.” I reflected that this saint descended from the general to the particular with disconcerting speed. “That is your cave.” The yogi bestowed on me a gaze of illumination which I have never forgotten."}
{"id": 1257, "text": "“That is your sacred mountain. That is where you will find the kingdom of God.”\nHis simple words instantaneously banished my lifelong obsession for the Himalayas.

{"id": 1271, "text": "“Then what about us poor mortals?”\n“Well, don’t you see, my dear boy, that God is Eternity Itself? To assume that one may fully know Him by forty-five years of meditation is rather a preposterous expectation."}

The spiritual radiations are not easily seen.” The saint added a few words of affection."}
{"id": 1276, "text": "At dawn Ram Gopal gave me rock candies and said I must depart. I felt such reluctance to bid him farewell that tears coursed down my cheeks. “I will not let you go empty-handed.” The yogi spoke tenderly. “I will do something for you.”\nHe smiled and looked at me steadfastly."}
{"id": 1277, "text": "I became immobile, as though rooted to the ground; vibrations of peace that emanated from the saint flooded my being.

{"id": 1785, "text": "By a secret yogic method, the saint unites his mind and astral vehicle with those of a suffering individual; the disease is conveyed, wholly or in part, to the yogi’s fleshy form. Having harvested God on the physical field, a master is no longer concerned with his body."}

{"id": 1789, "text": "Escaping to the superconsciousness whenever he so desires, a master can become oblivious of physical illness; sometimes, to set an example for disciples, he chooses to bear bodily pain stoically. By putting on the ailments of others, a yogi can satisfy, for them, the karmic law of cause and effect."}
{"id": 1790, "text": "This law is mechanically or mathematically operative; its workings may be scientifically manipulated by men of divine wisdom. The spiritual law does not require a master to become ill whenever he heals another person."}

{"id": 1792, "text": "On rare occasions, however, a master who wishes to quicken greatly his disciples’ evolution may then voluntarily work out on his own body a large measure of their undesirable karma. Jesus signified himself as a ransom for the sins of many."}
{"id": 1793, "text": "With his divine powers, 1 Christ could never have been subjected to death by crucifixion if he had not willingly cooperated with the subtle cosmic law of cause and effect. He thus took on himself the consequences of others’ karma, especially that of his disciples."}

{"id": 1795, "text": "An ordinary man cannot employ this yogic method of cure; nor is it desirable that he should do so, because an unsound physical instrument is a hindrance to deep meditation."}
{"id": 1796, "text": "The Hindu scriptures teach that an imperative duty of man is to keep his body in good condition; otherwise his mind is unable to remain fixed in devotional concentration. A very strong mind, however, can transcend all physical difficulties and attain to God-realization."}
{"id": 1797, "text": "Many saints have ignored illness and succeeded in their divine quest.

{"id": 1802, "text": "The father prayed with anguished determination that he receive the malady and that his son be spared. Humayun 3 recovered; Baber immediately fell sick and died of the same disease that had stricken his son. Many persons believe that a great master should have the health and strength of a Sandow."}

{"id": 1853, "text": "It is against the temple rules to feed those who do not make a request beforehand, but I have made an exception for you.”\nI thanked him, and gazed straight into Satish’s eyes. He flushed with emotion, lowering his gaze in silent repentance."}
{"id": 1854, "text": "When we were served a lavish meal, including out-of-season mangoes, I noticed that my brother-in- law’s appetite was meager. He was bewildered, diving deep into the ocean of thought. On the return journey to Calcutta, Satish, with softened expression, occasionally glanced at me pleadingly."}
{"id": 1855, "text": "But he did not speak a single word after the moment the priest, as though in answer to Satish’s challenge, had appeared to invite us to lunch. The following afternoon I visited my sister at her home. She greeted me affectionately."}

{"id": 1859, "text": "I was overjoyed to perceive that he had developed highly in Self-realization and had been blessed by a vision of the Divine Mother."}
{"id": 1860, "text": "During my stay with him I noticed that Satish secretly spent the greater part of each night in deep meditation, though he was suffering from a serious ailment, and was engaged during the day at his office. The thought came to me that my brother-in-law’s life span would not be a long one."}
{"id": 1861, "text": "Roma must have read my mind. “Dear brother,” she said, “I am well, and my husband is sick. Nevertheless, I want you to know that, as a devoted Hindu wife, I am going to be the first one to die."}
{"id": 1862, "text": "2 It won’t be long now before I pass on.”\nTaken aback at her ominous words, I yet realized their sting of truth. I was in America when my sister died, about eighteen months after her prediction. My youngest brother Bishnu later gave me the details."}
{"id": 1863, "text": "“Roma and Satish were in Calcutta at the time of her death,” Bishnu told me. “That morning she dressed herself in her bridal finery. “‘Why this special costume?’ Satish enquired. “‘This is my last day of service to you on earth,’ Roma replied. A short time later she had a heart attack."}

{"id": 1872, "text": "“Mukunda is a bit over-drunk with religion.” Thus summing me up, they tactfully spared me the embarrassment of trying to answer classroom questions; they trusted the final written tests to eliminate me from the list of A.B. candidates."}

He searched through a large pile of sheets on his desk."}
{"id": 1876, "text": "“Your paper isn’t here at all; you have failed, in any case, through non-appearance at the examination.”\n I chuckled. “Sir, I was there."}
{"id": 1877, "text": "May I look through the stack myself?”\nThe professor, nonplussed, gave his permission; I quickly found my paper, from which I had carefully omitted any identification mark except my roll-call number."}

{"id": 1882, "text": "My almost daily visits to Sri Yukteswar had left me little time to enter the college halls.

{"id": 1883, "text": "In one hand I would carry an offering for my guru—a few flowers from the garden of my Panthi boardinghouse. Greeting me affably, Master would invite me to lunch. I invariably accepted with alacrity, glad to banish the thought of college for the day."}

{"id": 1885, "text": "Occasionally I stayed all night with my guru, so happily engrossed in his conversation that I scarcely noticed when darkness changed into dawn. One night about eleven o’clock, as I was putting on my shoes in preparation for the ride to the boardinghouse, Master questioned me gravely."}
{"id": 1886, "text": "“When do your A.B. examinations start?” “Five days hence, sir.”\n“I hope you are in readiness for them.”\nTransfixed with alarm, I held one shoe in the air. “Sir,” I protested, “you know that my days have been passed with you rather than with the professors."}
{"id": 1887, "text": "How can I bring myself to enact a farce by appearing for those difficult finals?”\nSri Yukteswar’s eyes were turned piercingly on mine. “You must appear.” His tone was coldly peremptory. “We should not give cause for your father and other relatives to criticise your preference for ashram life."}
{"id": 1888, "text": "Just promise me that you will be present for the examinations; answer them the best way you can.”\n Uncontrollable tears were coursing down my face.

{"id": 1890, "text": "“Mukunda, has the Lord ever failed you, at an examination or elsewhere?”\n“No, sir,” I responded warmly. Grateful memories came in a revivifying flood. “Not laziness but burning zeal for God has prevented you from seeking college honours,” my guru said kindly."}

{"id": 1893, "text": "He is the honour man in our class, and carries a heavier course than the others.”\nMaster waved aside my objections. “Romesh will find time for you. Now go.”\nI bicycled back to the Panthi. The first person I met in the boardinghouse compound was the scholarly Romesh."}
{"id": 1894, "text": "As though his days were quite free, he obligingly agreed to my diffident request. “Of course! I am at your service.” He spent many hours of that day and of each of the next few days in coaching me in my various subjects."}

{"id": 1900, "text": "The boys who had been ridiculing me for my faith in Romesh’s coaching now almost deafened me with congratulations. During the week of the examinations I continued to spend as much time as possible with Romesh, who formulated questions that he thought were likely to be set by the professors."}
{"id": 1901, "text": "Day by day, Romesh’s questions appeared in almost the same words on the examination sheets."}
{"id": 1902, "text": "The news was widely circulated in the college that something resembling a miracle was occurring and that success seemed probable for the absentminded “Mad Monk.” I made no attempt to hide the facts of the case."}

{"id": 1905, "text": "The best mark I could possibly score in that paper would be 33—three points less than the passing mark of 36. I rushed to Master and poured out my troubles. “Sir, I have made an unpardonable blunder."}

{"id": 1909, "text": "As I reached the Panthi, I overheard a classmate’s remark: “I have just learned that this year, for the first time, the required passing mark in English literature has been lowered.”\nI entered the boy’s room with such speed that he looked up in alarm. I questioned him eagerly."}
{"id": 1910, "text": "“Long-haired monk,” he said laughingly, “why this sudden interest in scholastic matters? Why cry in the eleventh hour?

{"id": 1916, "text": "The first instruction was: “Give two instances of the charities of Vidyasagar.” 3 As I transferred to the paper the lore that I had so recently acquired, I whispered a few words of thanksgiving that I had heeded Romesh’s last-minute summons."}

{"id": 1973, "text": "Through the practical techniques of yoga, man leaves behind forever the barren realms of speculation and cognises in experience the veritable Essence. The Yoga system of Patanjali is known as the Eightfold Path. 9 The first steps are (1) yama (moral conduct), and (2) niyama (religious observances)."}
{"id": 1974, "text": "Yama is fulfilled by noninjury to others, truthfulness, nonstealing, continence, and noncovetousness. The niyama prescripts are purity of body and mind, contentment in all circumstances, self-discipline, self-study (contemplation), and devotion to God and guru."}
{"id": 1975, "text": "The next steps are (3) asana (right posture); the spinal column must be held straight, and the body firm in a comfortable position for meditation; (4) pranayama (control of prana , subtle life currents); and (5) pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses from external objects)."}
{"id": 1976, "text": "The last steps are forms of yoga proper: (6) dharana (concentration), holding the mind to one thought; (7) dhyana (meditation); and (8) samadhi (superconscious experience)."}
{"id": 1977, "text": "This Eightfold Path of Yoga leads to the final goal of Kaivalya (Absoluteness), in which the yogi realizes the Truth beyond all intellectual apprehension. “Which is greater,” one may ask, “a swami or a yogi?” If and when oneness with God is achieved, the distinctions of the various paths disappear."}
{"id": 1978, "text": "The Bhagavad Gita, however, has pointed out that the methods of yoga are all-embracing. Its techniques are not meant only for certain types and temperaments, such as those few persons who incline toward the monastic life; yoga requires no formal allegiance."}
{"id": 1979, "text": "Because the yogic science satisfies a universal need, it has a natural universal appeal. A true yogi may remain dutifully in the world; there he is like butter on water, and not like the unchurned, easily diluted milk of undisciplined humanity."}

{"id": 1983, "text": "These men could rise to even greater heights if they were taught the definite science of yoga, which makes possible a more conscious direction of one’s mind and life.

{"id": 1986, "text": "It offers the possibility of controllable experience and thus satisfies the scientific need for ‘facts’; and, besides this, by reason of its breadth and depth, its venerable age, its doctrine and method, which include every phase of life, it promises undreamed-of possibilities."}
{"id": 1987, "text": "“Every religious or philosophical practice means a psychological discipline, that is, a method of mental hygiene."}
{"id": 1988, "text": "The manifold, purely bodily procedures of Yoga 11 also mean a physiological hygiene which is superior to ordinary gymnastics and breathing exercises, inasmuch as it is not merely mechanistic and scientific, but also philosophical; in its training of the parts of the body, it unites them with the whole of the spirit, as is quite clear, for instance, in the Pranayama exercises where Prana is both the breath and the universal dynamics of the cosmos...."}

{"id": 2471, "text": "“Abhoya, behold, the light is almost gone!” He pointed to the lamp, which the nurse hastened to refill. As soon as it burned again brightly, the master vanished. The door closed; the latch was affixed without visible agency."}

{"id": 2478, "text": "“‘Sir,’ I replied, ‘a beautiful woman appears. She wears a red-bordered sari, and stands near an elephant-ear plant.’ All the other disciples gave the same description. The master turned to my employer."}
{"id": 2479, "text": "‘Do you recognise that woman?’\n“‘Yes.’ The man was evidently struggling with emotions new to his nature. ‘I have been foolishly spending my money on her, though I have a good wife. I am ashamed of the motives that brought me here."}

Thus I came to understand my guru’s veiled prophecy about the improbability of the man’s initiation.”\nLahiri Mahasaya had a famous friend, Trailanga Swami, who was reputed to be over three hundred years old.

{"id": 2485, "text": "For days together he would sit on top of the water or remain hidden for very long periods under the waves. A common sight at Manikarnika Ghat was the swami’s motionless body on the blistering stone slabs, wholly exposed to the merciless Indian sun."}
{"id": 2486, "text": "By these feats Trailanga sought to teach men that human life need not depend on oxygen or on certain conditions and precautions."}
{"id": 2487, "text": "Whether the great master was above water or under it, and whether or not his body challenged the fierce solar rays, he proved that he lived by divine consciousness: Death could not touch him. The yogi was great not only spiritually, but physically."}
{"id": 2488, "text": "His weight exceeded three hundred pounds: a pound for each year of his life! As he ate very seldom, the mystery is increased. A master, however, easily ignores all usual rules of health when he desires to do so for some special reason, often a subtle one known only to himself."}
{"id": 2489, "text": "Great saints who have awakened from the cosmic mayic dream and have realized this world as an idea in the Divine Mind, can do as they wish with the body, knowing it to be only a manipulatable form of condensed or frozen energy."}

{"id": 2491, "text": "The harassed police of Banaras came to regard him as a baffling problem child. The natural swami, like the early Adam in the Garden of Eden, was unconscious of his nakedness. The police were quite conscious of it, however, and unceremoniously committed him to jail."}
{"id": 2492, "text": "General embarrassment ensued: the enormous body of Trailanga was soon seen, in its usual entirety, on the prison roof. His cell, still securely locked, offered no clue to his mode of escape. The discouraged officers of the law once more performed their duty."}
{"id": 2493, "text": "This time a guard was posted before the swami’s cell. Might again retired before Right: the great master was soon observed in his nonchalant stroll over the roof.

{"id": 2494, "text": "The great yogi preserved a habitual silence. 4 In spite of his round face and huge, barrel-like stomach, Trailanga ate only occasionally. After weeks without food, he would break his fast with potfuls of clabbered milk offered to him by devotees."}

{"id": 2496, "text": "Please drink it.”\nTrailanga unhesitatingly drank, to the last drop, the quarts of burning lime. In a few minutes the evildoer fell to the ground in agony. “Help, Swami, help!” he cried. “I am on fire! Forgive my wicked test!”\nThe great yogi broke his habitual silence."}
{"id": 2497, "text": "“Scoffer,” he said, “you did not realize when you offered me poison that my life is one with your own. Except for my knowledge that God is present in my stomach, as in every atom of creation, the lime would have killed me."}
{"id": 2498, "text": "Now that you know the divine meaning of boomerang, never again play tricks on anyone.”\nThe sinner, healed by Trailanga’s words, slunk feebly away.

{"id": 2521, "text": "Besides a few of Master’s other disciples, I was present with a small group of my Ranchi students. “In this passage Jesus calls himself the Son of God. Though he was truly united with God, his reference here has a deep impersonal significance,” my guru explained."}

Because I had expected something material, Lahiri Mahasaya chose the nearby oil as an objective symbol to awaken my greater faith. The master allowed Rama to die, because I had partially doubted."}

{"id": 2630, "text": "‘I cannot accept you in your present state of development.’\n“The man immediately hurled himself over the cliff. Babaji instructed the shocked disciples to fetch the stranger’s body. After they had returned with the mangled form, the master placed his hand on the dead man."}

{"id": 3432, "text": "Recording their conversations in voluminous notes, I verified facts and dates, and collected photographs, old letters, and documents. My Lahiri Mahasaya portfolio began to swell; I realized with dismay that ahead of me lay arduous labours in authorship."}
{"id": 3433, "text": "I prayed that I might be equal to my role as biographer of the colossal guru. Several of his disciples feared that in a written account their master might be belittled or misinterpreted."}
{"id": 3434, "text": "“One can hardly do justice in cold words to the life of a divine incarnation,” Panchanon Bhattacharya had once remarked to me. Other close disciples were similarly satisfied to keep the Yogavatar hidden in their hearts as the deathless preceptor."}
{"id": 3435, "text": "Nevertheless, mindful of Lahiri Mahasaya’s prediction about his biography, I spared no effort to secure and substantiate the facts of his outward life."}
{"id": 3436, "text": "Swami Keshabananda greeted our party warmly at Brindaban in his Katyayani Peeth Ashram, an imposing brick building with massive black pillars, set in a beautiful garden. He ushered us at once into a sitting room adorned with an enlargement of Lahiri Mahasaya’s picture."}
{"id": 3437, "text": "The swami was approaching the age of ninety, but his muscular body radiated strength and health. With long hair and a snow-white beard, eyes twinkling with joy, he was a veritable patriarchal embodiment. I informed him that I wanted to mention his name in my book on India’s masters."}
{"id": 3438, "text": "Swami Keshabananda (standing, left), a ninety-year-old disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya; Yoganandaji; and C. Richard Wright, at Keshaba- nanda’s ashram, Brindaban, 1936\n “Please tell me about your earlier life.” I smiled entreatingly; great yogis are often uncommunicative."}
{"id": 3439, "text": "Keshabananda made a gesture of humility. “There is little of external moment. Practically my whole life has been spent in the Himalayan solitudes, travelling on foot from one quiet cave to another."}
{"id": 3440, "text": "For a while I maintained a small ashram outside Hardwar, surrounded on all sides by a grove of tall trees. It was a peaceful spot little visited by travellers, owing to the ubiquity of cobras.” Keshabananda chuckled. “Later a Ganges flood washed away the hermitage and cobras alike."}
{"id": 3441, "text": "My disciples then helped me to build this Brindaban ashram.”\nOne of our party asked the swami how he had protected himself against the Himalayan tigers. Keshabananda shook his head. “In those high spiritual altitudes,” he said, “wild beasts seldom molest the yogis."}
{"id": 3442, "text": "Once in the jungle I encountered a tiger face-to-face. At my sudden ejaculation, the animal was transfixed as though turned to stone.” Again the swami chuckled at his memories. 8\n“Occasionally I left my seclusion to visit my guru in Banaras."}

For him no Himalayan height is inaccessible!”\nTwo hours later he led us to a dining patio."}
{"id": 3445, "text": "I sighed in silent dismay. Another fifteen-course meal! Less than a year of Indian hospitality, and I had gained fifty pounds! Yet it would have been considered the height of rudeness to refuse any of the dishes, carefully prepared for the endless banquets in my honour."}
{"id": 3446, "text": "In India (nowhere else, alas!) a well-padded swami is considered a delightful sight. After dinner, Keshabananda led me to a secluded nook. “Your arrival is not unexpected,” he said. “I have a message for you.” I was surprised; no one had known of my plan to visit Keshabananda."}
{"id": 3447, "text": "“While roaming last year in the northern Himalayas near Badrinarayan,” the swami continued, “I lost my way. Shelter appeared in a spacious cave, which was empty, though the embers of a fire glowed in a hole in the rocky floor."}
{"id": 3448, "text": "Wondering about the occupant of this lonely retreat, I sat near the fire, my gaze fixed on the sunlit entrance to the cave. “ ‘Keshabananda, I am glad you are here.’ These words came from behind me."}

{"id": 3450, "text": "‘That is why you lost your way and were led to my temporary abode in this cave. It is a long time since our last meeting; I am pleased to greet you once more.’\n“The deathless master blessed me with some words of spiritual help, then added: ‘I give you a message for Yogananda."}

{"id": 3452, "text": "Tell him, then, that I won’t see him this time, as he is eagerly hoping; but I shall see him on some other occasion.’ ”\nI was deeply touched to receive from Keshabananda’s lips this consoling promise from Babaji."}
{"id": 3453, "text": "A certain hurt in my heart vanished; I grieved no longer that, even as Sri Yukteswar had hinted, Babaji did not appear at the Kumbha Mela . Spending one night as guests of the ashram, our party set out the following afternoon for Calcutta."}

{"id": 3462, "text": "News of the message reached my ears; anguished at its implications, I dropped to my knees and implored God that my guru’s life be spared. As I was about to leave Father’s home for the train, a divine voice spoke within. “Do not go to Puri tonight."}
