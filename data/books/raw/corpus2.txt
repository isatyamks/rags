Around 70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens experienced a dramatic shift in thinking known as the Cognitive Revolution. This allowed them to imagine abstract concepts, create complex plans, and cooperate in ways no other species could. Rather than just surviving as another primate, sapiens began to dominate the natural world.

Before this revolution, humans were not special compared to Neanderthals, Denisovans, or other human species. They lived in small groups, hunted, gathered, and used basic stone tools. Nothing distinguished them significantly from other animals in terms of strength or instincts.

The key breakthrough came with language. Unlike the simple calls of animals, human speech evolved to communicate complex ideas and share detailed information. This gave them the power to cooperate in groups larger than families or clans, laying the foundation for social complexity.

Language also enabled storytelling, and this was revolutionary. Humans could discuss things that didn’t physically exist—myths, spirits, and collective beliefs. These shared fictions allowed strangers to work together under common ideas, which no other species could do.

Even gossip played a crucial role. By talking about others, humans built trust, identified cheaters, and maintained group harmony. This small-scale bonding eventually scaled into larger communities where shared reputations and stories held people together.

The ability to imagine things beyond reality opened endless possibilities. Myths, totems, and rituals gave meaning and structure to life, turning scattered bands into cooperative societies. Fiction became the glue of culture, religion, and politics.

Though individuals were not stronger than lions or faster than gazelles, collective imagination made sapiens far more powerful. Through cooperation, they could plan hunts, corner animals, and defend themselves from predators in ways no other species could.

Cultural evolution began to accelerate faster than biological evolution. Knowledge was no longer limited to genes or instincts but could be taught, stored, and shared. This meant every generation could build upon the discoveries of the previous one.

As humans spread across Africa and beyond, they adapted to new environments and challenges. They developed new hunting tools, discovered better strategies, and expanded into regions previously dominated by other humans and large animals.

They encountered rivals like Neanderthals in Europe and Denisovans in Asia. Sometimes they interbred, leaving small genetic traces in modern humans. More often, they competed for resources, and sapiens’ cognitive edge eventually led to the extinction of these other human species.

By around 30,000 years ago, Homo sapiens were the only surviving human species. Their dominance was not based on strength but on adaptability, shared stories, and the ability to cooperate on a massive scale. They became the undisputed rulers of the human world.

Their hunting strategies grew increasingly sophisticated. Groups planned coordinated drives to trap and kill animals far larger than themselves. What gave them this edge was not muscle but imagination and communication.

Art and symbolic expression flourished during this time. Cave paintings, carvings, beads, and ornaments appeared, reflecting imagination and identity. These creations were not just decoration but carried cultural and spiritual meaning.

Religion likely began in this era, starting with animism—the belief that spirits existed in animals, trees, and rivers. These beliefs gave structure to rituals, shaped social norms, and deepened the sense of shared meaning in communities.

Leadership changed as well. Power was no longer just about physical dominance but about persuasion, storytelling, and charisma. Those who could weave compelling myths or unite groups under a common vision often rose as leaders.

Knowledge also became more durable. Skills like making fire, shaping tools, or tracking animals could now be explained through language. This allowed teaching to become cumulative, with discoveries preserved and passed down for generations.

Human expansion quickened as they migrated beyond Africa. By 45,000 years ago, sapiens had reached Australia, which required advanced planning, the building of boats, and the ability to organize large groups for long journeys.

These migrations often led to ecological disasters. In Australia, humans hunted giant kangaroos, wombats, and other large creatures to extinction. Their efficiency as hunters transformed ecosystems permanently.

A similar pattern unfolded in the Americas thousands of years later. As sapiens spread across the continents, mammoths, mastodons, and giant sloths vanished. Humans proved to be the first large-scale ecological force reshaping nature.

Wherever they went, sapiens left destruction in their wake. Unlike predators limited by instinct, humans could plan, adapt, and cooperate at scales that overwhelmed entire species. This ability marked them as history’s first ecological killers.

The revolution also sparked the beginnings of trade networks. People began exchanging shells, pigments, stones, and other resources across wide distances. These exchanges were possible because of trust in shared myths, identities, or symbolic value.

For most of history, humans lived as hunter-gatherers, moving with the seasons and relying on wild plants and animals. Around 12,000 years ago, however, humans began shifting toward farming. This slow transformation reshaped not only how people lived but also how societies and civilizations formed.

At first glance, farming looked like progress—it allowed humans to settle down, grow food, and multiply. Yet, Harari calls it “history’s biggest fraud.” Though agriculture supported larger populations, the daily life of farmers was often harder than that of foragers.

Hunter-gatherers had diverse diets, plenty of leisure, and relatively balanced nutrition. Early farmers, however, relied on a few staple crops like wheat, rice, or maize. This made their diet less varied and often less healthy, leading to malnutrition and disease.

Why did humans switch, then? It wasn’t a conscious choice of individuals but rather a trap of success. As farming produced more food, populations grew. With more mouths to feed, communities had no choice but to expand farming further, locking themselves into the cycle.

The domestication of plants and animals seemed like humans controlling nature. In reality, it was often the crops and animals that controlled humans. Wheat, for example, spread across the world not because it was easy, but because humans devoted endless labor to its survival.

Farming also introduced backbreaking labor. Clearing fields, planting, irrigating, and protecting crops required far more effort than foraging. Farmers spent long hours in repetitive, exhausting work, while their forager ancestors worked fewer hours to meet daily needs.

Permanent settlements changed human life dramatically. People began to live in villages and eventually towns, surrounded by fields and livestock. This stability came at a cost—diseases spread more easily in dense populations and among domesticated animals.

Living close to animals exposed humans to new pathogens. Diseases like smallpox, measles, and influenza originated from domesticated creatures. While farming increased food security, it also unleashed devastating plagues on human communities.

The Agricultural Revolution reshaped social structures. Hunter-gatherers had relatively equal societies, but farming introduced property, surplus, and hierarchy. Land ownership and wealth began to determine status, and social inequality became a lasting feature of civilization.

With surpluses of food, not everyone had to farm. This allowed the rise of specialists: craftsmen, priests, rulers, and soldiers. Villages grew into cities, and cities into kingdoms. The seeds of organized religion, bureaucracy, and states were planted.

Agriculture also transformed humanity’s relationship with the environment. Farmers reshaped landscapes with irrigation, terracing, and deforestation. Forests shrank, rivers were redirected, and ecosystems collapsed under human pressure.

Domesticated animals were crucial, but they often lived harsh lives. Cows, sheep, chickens, and pigs became mass-bred for human needs, often suffering confinement and exploitation. Harari suggests agriculture led to the “domestication of animals and humans alike.”

Religion evolved during this time to support farming societies. Instead of animism, people began worshipping agricultural gods tied to fertility, rain, and harvest. Rituals became tied to planting and harvesting cycles, cementing religion’s role in community life.

The shift also deepened humans’ sense of time. Foragers lived day-to-day, but farmers thought in terms of seasons, years, and generations. Calendars, rituals, and stories emerged to track the cycles of nature and ensure order in farming life.

One unintended consequence of farming was the rise of violence. Surplus food and land became things worth fighting over. Unlike foragers, who could move away when resources were scarce, farmers had to defend their fields and villages, leading to warfare.

Despite these drawbacks, the Agricultural Revolution endured because it could sustain more people. Even though individual lives may have been harder, the overall number of humans skyrocketed. From a biological perspective, the “success” of wheat and rice was remarkable.

Farming laid the foundation for large-scale cooperation beyond immediate family or tribe. It required rules, agreements, and systems to manage irrigation, storage, and trade. Over time, these practical needs grew into complex political and social institutions.

This revolution also reshaped human imagination. With more structured societies, myths of kings, gods, and social hierarchies became central. Stories now justified why rulers reigned, why land belonged to certain families, and why people had different roles.

The Agricultural Revolution, then, was not just about food. It was about reshaping the very fabric of human life. From equality to hierarchy, from mobility to permanence, and from wild freedom to domesticated discipline, it changed humanity forever.

As human societies grew larger after the Agricultural Revolution, cooperation became more difficult. Small groups could function with gossip and personal trust, but empires and cities needed something stronger. The solution came through shared myths that bound strangers together.

Three great unifiers emerged in history: money, empires, and universal religions. These systems allowed millions of people to cooperate under common rules, beliefs, and values. Each relied not on physical reality but on shared imagination.

Money was perhaps the most universal unifier. Unlike language or religion, it worked across cultures and regions. A coin or piece of gold held no intrinsic value, but everyone believed in its worth, making it a powerful tool for exchange and trust.

Unlike barter, which required mutual needs, money created flexibility. A farmer could sell wheat for silver and use that silver to buy shoes, even if the shoemaker had no need for wheat. This abstract trust in currency made large economies possible.

Money was also the most pluralistic system ever invented. It crossed borders, languages, and religions, functioning wherever people believed in it. Even enemies could trade with one another because money was neutral and impersonal.

Empires were another major force of unification. While they often spread through violence and conquest, they also brought diverse peoples under one political system. Roads, laws, and trade networks expanded, linking cultures that had once been isolated.

Harari emphasizes that empires were not only about power but also about integration. They spread ideas, technologies, and even religions across vast territories. What began as domination often turned into cultural fusion.

For example, the Roman Empire unified Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa under one political and legal system. Although it collapsed, its legacy of roads, laws, and Christianity shaped the world long after its fall.

The Persian Empire showed another model—rule through tolerance. By allowing diverse peoples to keep their customs and religions while paying taxes, it sustained stability across vast distances. This approach influenced later empires.

China became one of the most enduring examples of unification. The idea of a “Middle Kingdom” created a shared identity that survived dynasties, invasions, and centuries. Centralized bureaucracy and Confucian ideals helped hold it together.

Religion was the third great unifier, evolving from local animistic traditions into universal systems. Early religions tied to tribes or regions gave way to global faiths like Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam that aimed to unite all humanity.

Buddhism, for example, rejected rigid hierarchies and offered a universal path to escape suffering. It spread widely across Asia, adapting to local cultures yet retaining its core philosophy of compassion and mindfulness.

Christianity built on the ideas of Judaism but expanded them into a universal faith. It offered salvation to anyone who believed, regardless of status, gender, or ethnicity. Over time, it became deeply entwined with empires like Rome.

Islam emerged as another unifying force, combining religion, law, and governance into one system. It spread rapidly across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, creating a shared civilization that connected diverse peoples.

Unlike tribal religions, universal faiths created communities that crossed ethnic and geographic boundaries. They gave meaning to suffering, justified political systems, and offered moral codes that allowed large societies to function.

Religions also evolved to justify social orders. Hinduism, for example, provided legitimacy to caste divisions in India. Christianity often justified monarchies, while Confucianism reinforced bureaucracy and filial duty in China.

Just like money, religion was a system of shared stories. The gods or moral laws did not exist in physical reality, but millions believed in them. This collective faith created stable societies and long-lasting traditions.

Empires and religions often reinforced one another. Rulers used faith to legitimize power, while religions relied on political authority to spread. Together, they created vast webs of human cooperation that shaped civilization.

Harari argues that human history since the Agricultural Revolution has been a story of larger and larger unifications. From tribes to kingdoms, from empires to religions, humanity moved toward global networks of trust and belief.

By the first millennium CE, much of the world was already interconnected. Merchants traded along the Silk Road, empires rose and fell, and religions spread across continents. Though people remained divided, the foundations of global unity had been laid.
